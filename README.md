1. ExpressRestSample:
      It contains a sample rest service developed using Express JS. The Service serves HTML, JSON and XML response. This can be used for testing your html or mobile apps when you don't have your web service working or unable to access them, well this will only work if you already know what kind of response you are expecting.
